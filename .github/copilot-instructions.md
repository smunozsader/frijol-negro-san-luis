# AI Assistant Instructions - Frijol Negro San Luis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the commercialization of black beans (Frijol Negro) from San Luis Potosí, Mexico, with particular emphasis on:
- Market analysis for distribution channels (especially Mérida, Yucatán)
- Technical documentation and quality standards compliance
- Agricultural product specification sheets (fact sheets) development
- Mexican normative standards (NMX-FF-038-SCFI-2016) implementation

## Key Context & Domain Knowledge

### Agricultural Product Focus
- **Product**: Black beans (Frijol Negro de San Luis)
- **Origin**: San Luis Potosí, Mexico
- **Target Market**: Mérida, Yucatán (major hub for black bean consumption)
- **Volume Scale**: Large commercial quantities (1000+ tons)
- **Quality Standards**: Mexican Official Standards (NMX-FF-038-SCFI-2016)

### Critical Standards & Classifications
When working with bean quality specifications, reference the NMX-FF-038-SCFI-2016 standard which defines:
- **Quality Grades**: Extra (≤14% humidity, ≤0.5% impurities), Primera (≤14% humidity, ≤1% impurities), Segunda (≤16% humidity, ≤3% impurities)
- **Defect Tolerances**: Damaged grains (≤3-10% by grade), broken grains (≤1-4%), stained/wrinkled (≤2-5%)
- **Testing Methods**: Oven drying (130°C), sieve analysis (4mm mesh), visual inspection

### Commercial Documentation Patterns
The project emphasizes professional fact sheets that include:
1. **Organoleptic characteristics** (appearance, color uniformity, texture)
2. **Bromatological quality** (humidity, impurities, damage percentages)
3. **Nutritional information** (341 kcal/100g, 21-22g protein, 62g carbs, 15g fiber)
4. **Microbiological standards** (absence of E.coli/Salmonella, coliforms <1000 cfu/g)
5. **Storage & logistics** (polypropylene sacks, 24-month shelf life, cooking time 90-120 min)

## File Structure & Key Documents

### Primary Documentation
- `consulta grok frijol negro.md` - Main project consultation document with detailed market analysis and commercial processes
- `NORMAS REFERENCIA/` - Contains official Mexican standards (NMX-FF-038-SCFI-2016 PDFs)
- `frijol negro, consulta grok.gdoc` - Google Doc with additional consultation materials

### Reference Standards Location
Mexican normative documents are stored in `NORMAS REFERENCIA/` and should be referenced for:
- Quality classification criteria
- Testing methodology specifications  
- Commercial grade definitions
- Regulatory compliance requirements

## Development Approach

### Market Analysis Focus
When generating content about bean commercialization:
- Emphasize the Mérida-Yucatán market as primary target due to regional culinary demand
- Reference sustainable agricultural practices aligned with Ley de Desarrollo Rural Sustentable
- Consider logistics from San Luis Potosí (~1500km to Mérida) in cost calculations
- Account for seasonal demand patterns in traditional Mexican cuisine

### Technical Documentation Style
- Use precise measurements and percentages based on official standards
- Include specific testing methods (visual inspection + counting, manual separation, color classification)
- Reference laboratory certification requirements (SENASICA, EMA accreditation)
- Maintain professional format suitable for institutional buyers (DICONSA, Walmart, Central de Abastos)

### Quality Assurance Integration
Always validate technical specifications against:
- Official NMX standards rather than generic agricultural guidelines
- Current market prices from SIAP/Government sources (typically 15-20 MXN/kg)
- Microbiological safety standards for food products
- Traceability requirements for T-MEC compliance

## Specialized Terminology
- **Acopio**: Collection/aggregation of agricultural products
- **Comercializadores**: Commercial distributors/traders
- **Hoja técnica/Fact sheet**: Technical specification document
- **Características organolépticas**: Sensory characteristics (appearance, smell, taste, texture)
- **Calidad bromatológica**: Food composition and nutritional analysis
- **Grado Extra/Primera/Segunda**: Official quality grades per Mexican standards

When assisting with this project, prioritize accuracy to Mexican agricultural standards and commercial practices over generic agricultural advice.
